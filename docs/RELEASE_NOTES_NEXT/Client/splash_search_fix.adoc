Fix for Staff Splash Page Multi-Word Search
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The addition of the Angular Staff Catalog surfaced a double-encoding issue
with redirects in certain Apache versions. This caused searches for multiple
words to have %20 in place of spaces, almost certainly resulting in 0 results.

In order to apply this fix, change the Angular redirects in eg_vhost.conf from

 RewriteRule ^/eg2/(.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}/eg2/en-US/$1 [R=307,L]

to

 RewriteRule ^/eg2/(.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}/eg2/en-US/$1 [NE,R=307,L]
